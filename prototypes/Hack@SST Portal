# Hack@SST Member Portal

**Created by:** Lai Hong Yu, Chiew Leung Yin 

## 🌟 Elevator Pitch  
It's a Google Classroom Alternative

## ⚙️ How It Works  
It uses Firebase, Firebase Auth and NextJS and API to enhance security as well as store data.

## 🎮 How It Plays (for YSWS or Workshops)  
It's a project where students can go into the portal and check their attendance, announcements and more...

## 🚀 The Development Plan  
I am working with my members of the club to build the website.
1. We need to build the Backend
2. Once that is done, it needs to be linked to the frontend
3. From there, we can worl in improving the UI

## 🔥 What Challenges Do You Anticipate?  
1. The time taken for loading Announcements and Attendance is unnecessary long
2. Ensuring the data can reach user while not revealing the API key 

## 🎯 What Do You Hope to Learn?  
1. Enhancing Security of my softwares
2. Learning NextJS deeply
