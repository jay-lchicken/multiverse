# 🌀 **Multiverse 2025: The Hack Club SuperLeader Summit**  

We’re bringing together a group of ~75 committed Hack Club Leaders (will be referred to as “SuperLeaders” from this point onwards) to a 8-week opportunity to build and prototype a collaborative and technical full club YSWS, Club project, or workshop. Once planned and run at a meeting, SuperLeaders will be eligible for travel stipends to come to San Francisco for a 3-day gathering & hackathon where they can work together to get feedback and build their final resource, publishing it to the entire Clubs community.

📍 **San Francisco, CA**  
📆 **March 28 - March 30, 2025**

In the next 8 weeks, **SuperLeaders** must **create a prototype**—a **YSWS, workshop, or club project**—and **test it in their own club** before arriving at the event. They will **gather feedback, refine their work, and document their process** in a project submission.  

### 🚀 **At Mission Control**  

Upon arrival, Hack Club Super Leaders will form teams to further develop, enhance, and battle-test their prototypes, preparing their projects for real-world action.  

On the final day, leaders will **submit their final prototypes to GitHub, locking them into the Multiverse’s Codex.** Their work won’t just **stop Heidi’s chaos**—it will **empower Hack Clubbers across the world** to build better, stronger workshops and projects.  


## **🦸 Who Can Join?**  

Any **high school Hack Club leader** ready to **step up, innovate, and save the Multiverse.**
